**<h3>User Stories</h3>** 
 - As a user, I want to be able to sign up and create an account with a username and password, so that I have access to the app.</br>

 - As a user, I want to have a “board” for my project, so that I can see and manage my project.</br>
 - As a user, I want the board for my project to have three lists called “To Do,” “Doing,” and “Done,” so that I can keep track of what needs to get done, what I am in the process of doing, and what has 
   already gotten done.</br>
 - As a user, I want to be able to add or create a “task” to any of the three lists, so that I can add to the progress of my project at any stage.</br>
 - As a user, I want to add a task to a list and be able to input specific details, including a title, description, date created, date due, and status, so that I can understand the task, its 
   requirements, its creation and due dates, and its placement within the three lists based on its status.</br>
 - As a user, I want to be able to edit the details of any task, so that I can update its information or move it to a different list as needed.</br>
 - As a user, I want to be able to delete a task, so that if it is no longer necessary it will no longer appear in the list.</br>
